**Executive Summary**
This report outlines the analysis of an existing information system, the in-house Call Management Centre (CMC), 
at a major travel agency. It will offer a proposal of an improved system, that will provide assistance to employees at 
the agency, Relationship Managers (RM), so that they can provide a high quality, efficient service for customers, in order 
to improve company sales. In order to elicit requirements and generate an understanding of the overall system, analysis of 
the company’s description was undertaken, and any gaps in understanding were assumed.

**Problem Definition**
Creating strong customer relationships and improving service is a key goal for the major travel agency, as this provides 
them with greater sales and an advanced mechanism for employee-to-customer communication. Currently, their system doesn’t 
deliver their service to the standard of quality and efficiency that they desire. The stagnant status of their operations 
signals the need for change, in order to meet their long-term operational objectives. To upgrade their call centre management 
system, the procedures of communication should be re-designed, via improved call routing and dynamic flow control for both 
inbound and outbound calls and by aiding employees such as Relationship Managers (RM) in serving customers, through profile 
matching mechanisms. In this way, the travel agency can streamline their operations and develop an efficient manner of 
communication for employees and customers, further leading to stronger sales.

Objectives 
The main objective of this project is to introduce an upgraded call management centre system,
to improve the operations of a major travel company, helping them generate more sales. 
Due to the varying number and nature of their products, holiday packages, their current system is complicated, 
so the new system aims to provide a tool which simplifies this, and matches customers with specific Relationship Managers 
who can provide tailored services according to their skill profiles. 
The project implementation will enable the ability to provide a more specific
and efficient service and establish strong customer relationships, resulting in repeat sales.

Assumptions
- There are enough RMs on shift to deal with the flow of customers on a regular day
- Same RMs are on shift every day
- RMs have knowledge on all of the travel packages being offered by the company
- RMs have the ability to transfer customers on the call to different RMs who are more knowledgeable about the travel packages that are being discussed
- Customers are aware of the different packages being offered through the media advertisement


Stakeholders 
INTERNAL:
- Relationship Managers (from CMC)
- End-Customers/potential buyers
- Investors/Shareholders - provides funding 

EXTERNAL:
- Media Platforms - advertises travel packages via email and social media.
- Telecommunications company

#Executive Summary

#Problem Definition
Choosing travel packages can be time-consuming and difficult due to the vast amount of information available online. The new system being developed will allow calls from customers to be routed to certain Relationship Managers (RM) who specialise in particular products and can thus help them choose the right holiday  package. The RM will differentiate customers on the basis of the Profiler tool which contains all of the customers information like surname and postcode, and culture. The information provided in the Profiler will increase the possibility of the relationship manager landing and closing a sale with the customer. The Profiler tool allows the relationship manager to build a connection with the customer which is vital in making a sale. Thus, the Call Management Centre (CMC) System will add significant value to the organisation and will help improve current work processes. Therefore, the CMC System will provide a way to automate current processes within the travel company which currently require human intervention. 

#Objectives
The main objective of this project is to introduce an upgraded call management centre system, to improve the operations of a major travel company, helping them generate more sales. Due to the varying number and nature of their products (holiday travel packages) their current system is complicated. The new system aims to provide a tool that simplifies business processes and matches customers with specific RMs who can provide tailored services according to their skill profiles. The project implementation will enable the ability to provide a more specific and efficient service and establish strong customer relationships, resulting in repeat sales with loyal customers.

#Assumptions
* There are enough RMs on shift to deal with the flow of customers on a regular day
* Same RMs are on shift every day
* RMs have knowledge on all of the travel packages being offered by the company
* RMs have the ability to transfer customers on the call to different RMs who are more knowledgeable about the travel packages that are being discussed
* Customers are aware of the different packages being offered through the media advertisement
* Customers are able to order the travel packages straight from the RM
* Customers profiles are created using the profiler tool before being matched with the appropriate RM on the phone
* Call routing and distribution routine has info about customers to distribute to correct RM who specialises on travel packages

#Stakeholders 
**Internal:**
*Relationships Manager (RM)
	* The RM is a key stakeholder in this project as they are the main users and are the employees of the travel agency who directly interact with the system and company. The requirements of RMs are important as they will impact the way in which the system is designed and implemented.

*End-customer
	* The end-customer is a consumer of the services and potential buyer of the products provided by the travel agency. The system should be designed for their ease of use, as they are the stakeholders who provide sales for the travel agency.

* Shareholders
	* Shareholders own a portion of the company, and thus are included as stakeholders, as they obtain partial interest in business activities. If the system fails, it impacts their position and contribution to the travel agency.

**External:**
*Media platforms
	* Technological platforms, including social media applications, websites, blogs and email, are stakeholders in the travel agency as they are involved in the marketing and communications of company activity.

*Telecommunications company
	*The CMC involves calling via telephone as a main function to connect customers with the company, hence the telecommunication company is involved in assuring their service supports the system.

Reflection on Assumptions 

After analysing the travel company’s situation, it is assumed that there are enough Relationship Managers (RMs) every day,
and the same RMs are hired on a full-time contract, resulting in consistency of shift and service provided. All RMs are 
assumed to have basic knowledge of all travel packages being offered by the travel company, however are not required to 
specialise in all product areas. Hence, RMs are assumed to have the capability to transfer their customer on a call to a
different RM, who can assist their specific requirements. This may occur if the first RM was wrongly matched to the customer
by the system, if there is a more specialised RM in the product, or other relevant reasons. Additionally, it is assumed that 
customers have the ability to discover the different packages the travel company offers, through other media platforms such 
as advertisements, a website and social media. It is further assumed that when customers get in a call with the RM, they are
not only able to receive information about travel packages and other services, as well as, purchase the product they would 
like in the same conversation. It is assumed that prior to being matched with an appropriate RM, customer profiles are 
created using the Profiler Tool. The CMC System through the call routing and distribution routine has customer information 
necessary to properly distribute the call to the appropriate RM for the travel package requested.


We also used the Point of View statements created to empathise with stakeholders’ and understand their challenges and needs, to develop How Might We (HMW) statements. These HMW statements help us understand what is needed in the new system for the stakeholders’ to have it running effectively.

POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS:
If the proposed project implementation were to fail, this would result in various adverse impacts on the social, financial
and operational aspects of the company. Foremost, investments made for the planning, tools and other labour involved in 
the implementation of the project would be lost, which could negatively impact the travel agency’s profits and long-term 
financial position. The company would now have to spend further allocated time and money on developing and testing a new 
system or instead planning how to modify the system to implement it successfully. This would cause delays in future business 
plans, for example expansion or differentiation plans, inhibiting their abilities to fulfil their business objectives.
Employees of the travel agency also become unfavourably impacted by the system project failure, as they may become 
frustrated and unmotivated to perform their tasks, due to the disruptive changes in the workplace. This may lead to weaker 
customer relationships and hence decreased total sales generated. This impact may reflect in social aspects, such as 
reputational damage, where the company may be seen as incapable of producing and implementing a functional system, 
potentially impacting their corporate status and relationship with other businesses.
